##Visual gallery of my GitHub repos 
This project is a visual gallery of my GitHub repos. It fetches from both the REST and the GraphQL API, from which I was able to pull the social preview image as well as the readme text. 
A user profile and repository list are displayed on the main gallery. By clicking on the repos image, users can access them invidually in order to see them in more detail. Links to the github repository as well as the live version (if there is one) are available.
